# HawkerTrove
Created with CodeSandbox
This is real world problem based project. Basically This project solves everyone's problem. Like some people/women cannot go out to fetch vegetables or fruits. They always think that hawker come to them but it doesn't happen all the time. They have to wait for the hawker & sometime the hawker don't even come and they get panic. So, I solved their problem. 
In this website, server should have to register in our website. so, after that people can search them using this website & they can find hawker in the nearest location. The hawker can go to the peoples home or people can go to the nearby hawker to buy their things whatever they want. By using this website people can ask the hawker that the item they want is available or not. According to that they can book the hawker.
